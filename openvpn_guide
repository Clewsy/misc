Put all files in /etc/openvpn

Need to include "ca.crt", "ta.key" and *.ovpn.

Add "daemon" to end of *.ovpn file do daemonize after initialisation.

Change line "auth-user-pass" to "auth-user-pass <path_to_credentials_text_file>" to automate login.

<path_to_credentials_text_file> should consist of two lines of text.  The first is the login, the second is the password.

To run:
sudo openvpn <path_to_ovpn_file>
